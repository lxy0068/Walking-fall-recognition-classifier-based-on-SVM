# Walking-fall-recognition-classifier-based-on-SVM
The project includes scripts for feature extraction from images and predicting their classes based on these features. It uses techniques such as SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) to generate a feature set for image classification.
